# SQLAlchemy Challenge - Surfs Up!


## Where did the data come from?

The hawaii.sqlite database is provided by Monash University Data Analytics Bootcamp.


## Climate Analysis and Exploration

Use Python and SQLAlchemy to do basic climate analysis and data exploration of the climate database. 

### Precipitation Analysis

* Design a query to retrieve the last 12 months of precipitation data.

* Select only the `date` and `prcp` values.

* Load the query results into a Pandas DataFrame and set the index to the date column.

* Sort the DataFrame values by `date`.

* Plot the results using the DataFrame `plot` method.

* Use Pandas to print the summary statistics for the precipitation data.

### Station Analysis

* Design a query to calculate the total number of stations.

* Design a query to find the most active station.

* Design a query to retrieve the last 12 months of temperature observation data (TOBS) of the most active station.

  * Plot the results as a histogram


## Climate App

Design a Flask API based on the queries developed.

### Routes

* `/`

  * Home page.

  * List all routes that are available.

* `/api/v1.0/precipitation`

  * Convert the query results to a dictionary using `date` as the key and `prcp` as the value.

  * Return the JSON representation of your dictionary.

* `/api/v1.0/stations`

  * Return a JSON list of stations from the dataset.

* `/api/v1.0/tobs`

  * Query the dates and temperature observations of the most active station for the last year of data.
  
  * Return a JSON list of temperature observations (TOBS) for the previous year.

* `/api/v1.0/<start>` and `/api/v1.0/<start>/<end>`

  * Return a JSON list of the minimum temperature, the average temperature, and the max temperature for a given start or start-end range.

  * When given the start only, calculate `TMIN`, `TAVG`, and `TMAX` for all dates greater than and equal to the start date.

  * When given the start and the end date, calculate the `TMIN`, `TAVG`, and `TMAX` for dates between the start and end date inclusive.


## Temperature Analysis I

* Identify the average temperature in June at all stations across all available years in the dataset. Do the same for December temperature.

* Use the t-test to determine whether the difference in the means, if any, is statistically significant.


## Temperature Analysis II

* Calculate the min, avg, and max temperatures for the holiday using the matching dates from the previous year.

* Plot the min, avg, and max temperature as a bar chart.

  * Use the average temperature as the bar height.

  * Use the peak-to-peak (TMAX-TMIN) value as the y error bar (YERR).
  

## Daily Rainfall Average

* Calculate the rainfall per weather station using the previous year's matching dates.

* Calculate the daily normals. Normals are the averages for the min, avg, and max temperatures.

* Use Pandas to plot an area plot for the daily normals.
